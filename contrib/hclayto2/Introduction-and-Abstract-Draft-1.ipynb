    "In this paper, I will analyze the effects of environmental regulations on the price of housing in the United States. I will begin by reviewing the existing literature on this topic before describing my own research methods and findings. According to my review of the literature, there is a rather limited amount of academic research on the effects of environmental regulations on the housing market. A 2004 review of the literature by economist Katherine Kiel described studies that consider the effects of environmental laws on both the quantity and price of housing. Several studies have demonstrated how environmental regulations, by improving environmental quality, have driven up demand, and therefore prices, for housing in some cases. Fewer scholars have focused on the supply side as opposed to the demand side of the housing market the. It comes to the effects of environmental regulations. One study by Benton and Pollack (1992) looked at the economic effects of land-use environmental protection policies. The authors focused their study on the effects of Maryland's Critical Area Law and found that the law had a positive overall effect on the market, as vacant land values held steady and residential housing values rose. This study shows how environmental policy can be crafted to balance environmental protection with developmental needs.\n",

    "# Abstract\n",
    "In this paper, I will first present my research method before diving into the results and their implications for future environmental policies. I will focus my study on California's landmark environmental protection law, the California Environmental Quality Act or CEQA. This law, which was recently largely repealed, and other similar laws around the country have been blamed for blocking the construction of affordable housing and contributing to the rise in housing prices in recent decades. I will analyze these claims by looking at specific instances in which CEQA was invoked and then analyzing the effects on housing prices in the following years. This methodology follows from the fact that CEQA has frequently been used by different groups, such as businesses or home owner associations, to block the construction of housing. There is data provided by FRED on housing prices in California over time (the All-Transactions House Price Index for California, which goes back to 1975) and also census-tract level data in the state provided by California Open Data (the Housing Cost Burden dataset). This second data set shows \"the percent of households paying more than 30% (or 50%) of monthly household income towards housing costs for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts.\" I plan on using this data to analyze whether housing cost burdens rise or fall after the usage of CEQA in a particular area. \n"
